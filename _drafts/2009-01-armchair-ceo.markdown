title: Armchair CEO or Where I would take the AppleTV and Mac Mini
---

Armchair CEO is a series of posts that take my zero years of experience in making a product, and use to show that I know what's best for whatever I feel like blabbering on about at the time. Its self indulgent, arrogant, and fun as shit. Let the waxing begin.

My first idea is for the AppleTV and Mac Mini. Two products in the Macintosh product line that, in my opinion, don't really fit.
