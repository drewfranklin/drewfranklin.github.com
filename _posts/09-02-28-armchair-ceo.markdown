title: Armchair CEO Vol. 1
sub-title: or Where I would take the AppleTV and Mac Mini
---

Armchair CEO is a series of posts that take my zero years of experience in making a product, and use it to show that I know what's best for whatever I feel like blabbering on about at the time. It is self indulgent, but fun as shit.

My first idea is for the AppleTV and Mac Mini. The two products should be joined into one product that is controlled by the iPhone. In [MacBreak Weekly Episode 124](http://twit.tv/mbw124), Andy Ihnatko said [this](http://lonelysandwich.com/post/72699069/apple-is-a-story) when talking about Steve Jobs' ability to curate apple products, specifically the iPod,

> But at the same point, he is the guy who takes a look at the entire story that Apple is telling and makes sure that nothing extraneous enters the dialogue and enters the storyline.
> They’ve always been about a small, lean cast of characters that each support each other. There’s no product in Apple’s product line that does not in some way enhance or support every other product in Apple’s product line.

I believe neither the Mac Mini nor the AppleTV fit into this precise story. It is apparent that Jobs feels this way as well. I don't think he has (or at least rarely) talked about the Mini in a keynote since its announcement, and has publicly called the AppleTV a [hobby](http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/01/21/apple_tv_sales_rise_300_will_see_continued_investment.html).

It is time for Apple to remove the Mac Mini from its hardware line and make the AppleTV a full time job. If Apple created an "AppleTV touch" similar to what the iPod touch is to the iPod, it would be far more successful. Like the iPod touch, the AppleTV touch would still be mainly used and marketed for its intended purpose: playing media on a television. Also like the iPod touch, AppleTV touch would beautifully hide the fact that it is indeed a computer, giving it the huge advantage of applications, specifically the App Store's bread and butter... games.

The iPhone and iPod touch have created a whole new market of casual games for people who normally would not be interested in them. Transferring these games to the television would continue Apple's under the radar front against the gaming industry by taking one of [most advanced gaming controllers](http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/gallery/ads/) to a larger screen.

It is also important to remember that people who were using Mini's would still be able to do the exact same tasks they were doing before: including browsing the web, checking email, and listening to music. If the Mac hardware line is designed for producing content, with software like Garageband and iMovie, the AppleTV touch is designed for consuming it. This fits into Apple's style of unapologetically creating the minimal set of features to appeal to most of their customers.     

Now here is the important part, and it is the reason I don't run Apple. See, I had a horrible Sony Ericsson phone that I was trying to get to check email, listen to music, and sync Address Book and Calender through iSync, but at that time I couldn't have begun to imagine the iPhone. I have specifically left all of the implementation details out about this supposed "AppleTV touch", because the more I think about logistics, the more my argument begins to fall apart rapidly. This is where Apple takes the pieces that [technically savvy people](http://hicksdesign.co.uk/tag/mediacenter/) know are in place, and makes something highly integrated, beautiful, usable and fun for everyone.
