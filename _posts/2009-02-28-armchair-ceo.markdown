title: Armchair CEO Vol. 1
sub-title: or Where I would take the AppleTV and Mac Mini
---

Armchair CEO is a series of posts that take my zero years of experience in making a product, and use to show that I know what's best for whatever I feel like blabbering on about at the time. Its self indulgent, but fun as shit.

My first idea is for the AppleTV and Mac Mini. The two products should be joined into one product that runs a variation of the iPhoneOS and is controlled by the iPhone. It should be a new catagory of computer that isn’t associated with the mac hardware line. It would be its own entity. I think of it as more a companion computer, but could be a main computer for someone who only checks email, browses the web, and buys from iTunes. Which to my knowledge is a lot of people. I think of it as a a casual computer. It’s made to do the consuming of content, not to do work, edit video, pictures or music.

Why run the iPhoneOS? Well first as per the financial reports the iPhone kicked ass (link to financial reports). So I won’t be suprised if a lot of resources are going into the iPhone and specifically the OS. Also when you look at an iPhone it is a mobile version of the casual computer I described above. The new AppleTV would be perfectly suited for the functionality of the iPhoneOS (I feel even more so than a would be Tablet iPhone). Looking at the iTunes Sync page you could imagine a very similar one for the new AppleTV. Address Book for use in Mail. Calendars because how cool would a big fucking calendar look on a TV screen 

And why the iPhone as a controller? (Well I think it should have both the option to run a wireless keyboard and mouse and iPhone but most would use the iPhone). Since I imagine this being used on a couch, the small form factor  the touch screen allows for mouse like functions without the need of a table top.

I will give you a kind of scenario of what I think could happen with this product. I imagine sitting down and wanting to listen to music, and since one thing electronic cosumers know how to do is buy a nice stereo system with a nice TV it is going to sound good. I then start switch to safari and begin to read an article on the NY Times preferably the andrew bird blog series. I get board so I switch to a game I bought on the app store like a wii tenis using my iPhone as the remote or X Plane like it is on the iPhone only you are viewing it many times larger on a beautiful tv. Then I go to watch something maybe an office episode on hulu or a movie on netfilx. So I start watching teen wolf 2 on netflix instantly I then want to check something on IMDB so I check it quickly and movie back to the movie right where I started. All seems pretty cool right?

Two products in the Macintosh product line that, in my opinion, don't really fit. And as to why don't they fit, they do too little for what people expect. At least for the AppleTV it is evident that it does to little given by the number of people who hack it . The Mac Mini in the Line of hardware products just looks out of place and I think one of the
